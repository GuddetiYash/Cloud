    <br />
    <li><strong>Standard: </strong>This license is designed for non-simulation roles. It combines the permissions of Reviewer, Executive, and Editor roles into a single, scalable option.

  <p>Tenant administrators can manage access to <strong>PLEXOS Intelligence</strong> directly from the <strong>Central License Manager (CLM)</strong> under the <strong>Tenant Preferences</strong> section.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This  provides a centralized way to <strong>enable or disable</strong> the PLEXOS Intelligence feature across all platforms including <strong>PLEXOS Cloud</strong>, <strong>PLEXOS Desktop</strong>, and the <strong>Excel Add-In</strong> ensuring better alignment with your organization&#39;s usage policies or compliance requirements.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <h2 id="11">Log In to AURORA</h2>
  <p>Follow the steps below to access the AURORA Desktop application using CLM:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>1.  Download and Install AURORA 15.0 from the <a href="https://portal.energyexemplar.com/?view=software#24">Energy Exemplar Customer Portal.</a></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>2.  After installation, you will see the Sign In dialog as below:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px">     <img height="252" src="../assets/images/Central License Manager/Aurora Sign In  page.png" width="315" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have already logged into Aurora 15.0 with a legacy Aurora License, you will not see this login popup since Aurora 15.0 uses the old license file to log in directly. To view this pop-up, you need to either:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>Rename the old license (Aurora.license) in <strong>C:\ProgramData\Energy Exemplar\Aurora</strong>. You can rename it to anything and Aurora 15.0 will not be able to find a license and this Popup will show up.<br />
      <br />
      -OR-<br />
       
    </li>
    <li>Refresh the license from <strong>File-&gt;Account-&gt;Refresh License.</strong> Click on the <strong>Refresh License</strong> button to delete all the license files. You will need to log into Aurora 14.2 and prior versions using the legacy credentials. You can use the Rename license option above if you don’t remember your legacy username and password (you typically need it to sign once a year).<br />
      <br />
      <br />

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Legacy Aurora License button allows you to get license files from a legacy license server. Once your company switches to User Licensing provided by CLM, the legacy license file will expire within 30 days for Aurora 15.0 and all users from your company must use User Licensing to log into Aurora 15.0. For 14.2 and prior versions, the Legacy Licensing works as usual.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>3.  Select the desired environment from the <b>Environment</b> Dropdown.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px">     <img height="255" src="../assets/images/Central License Manager/Select Env. in AURORA pop up.png" width="323" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>4.  Click on the <b>User Sign In</b> button to redirect to the Login page for the selected environment.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>5.  Enter the valid credentials (Email Address and Password) for your account and click on the <b>SIGN IN</b></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>       NOTE:</b> Click on the <b>Forgot Password?</b> link to reset your password anytime.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>6.  A pop-up will appear on the top of your screen to prompt you to open the AURORA desktop application. Click on the <b>Open Aurora Desktop Application</b> button.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px">     <img height="126" src="../assets/images/Central License Manager/Open aurora desktop app pop up.png" width="531" /></p>

  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px"> </p>
  <h2>Verify License File for Aurora</h2>
  <p>You can verify CLM generated license information in the License file available below on your PC:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Energy Exemplar\Aurora</b></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px"><img height="219" src="../assets/images/Central License Manager/Verify License File.png" width="716" /></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px"> </p>
  <h2>Log into previous Aurora Versions</h2>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px">CLM is only supported on <strong>Aurora 15.0 or newer versions</strong>. To continue using previous Aurora versions, use your legacy login username and password or go to <strong>C:\ProgramData\Energy Exemplar\Aurora</strong>, and change the renamed license file back to its original name <strong>“Aurora.license”.</strong></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:11px"> </p>
  <h2 id="12">Troubleshooting</h2>
  <p>The new centralized log collection feature consolidates essential log files and configuration data into a single, user-defined location on your machine to streamline diagnostics and support for the Central License Manager (CLM). This enhancement simplifies log management and facilitates ease of access and share for support resolution.<br />
    <br />
    <img src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Centralized log files.png" />
  </p>
  <p>Previously scattered across multiple directories, log files for PLEXOS Desktop, Central License Manager, and CLI are now automatically stored in a single, user defined folder, making retrieval straightforward.<br />
           </p>
  <p>To define the destination folder for centralized log collection, run the following command in Command Prompt:</p>
  <p><strong>     pxc environment diagnostic-information -d &quot;Folder path where the Log Files will be stored&quot;</strong><br />
    <br />
    <img height="143" src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Log files collection comand.png" width="736" />
  </p>
  <p>Upon completion, a confirmation message will appear. Logs are saved in the &quot;PLEXOS-Logs-&lt;Date of Collection&gt;&quot; folder for easy access.</p>
