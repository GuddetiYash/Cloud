  <h3 id="3.3"><br />
    [D] Chart Types</h3>
  <p>Chart types are particularly useful for visualizing how different data segments contribute to a total, making it easier to track changes and identify patterns over time. The available chart types include:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li><strong>Line Chart:</strong> A line chart displays data points connected by straight lines, ideal for showing trends over time or continuous data. This chart type helps you easily identify patterns or changes in data over a specific period.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>LineStacked:</strong> A stacked line chart displays multiple data series as lines, with each series stacked on top of the previous one.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> A bar chart represents data with rectangular bars, where the length of each bar corresponds to the value it represents. This chart type is excellent for comparing individual data points across different categories.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>BarStacked: </strong>A stacked bar chart represents data with rectangular bars divided into segments. Each segment represents a different data series, stacked one on top of the other within the same bar.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Area Chart:</strong> An area chart is similar to a line chart, but the area beneath the line is filled in. This helps emphasize the magnitude of data and is useful when you want to visualize both trends and cumulative values over time.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>AreaStacked:</strong> A stacked area chart is similar to a line chart but with the area below each line filled in and stacked on top of the other series.</li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p><strong>Step:</strong> A step chart is a variation of a line chart where the data points are connected by a series of steps rather than straight lines. Step charts are ideal for showing changes that occur at specific points in time, such as changes in pricing, inventory levels, or interest rates.</p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p><strong>StepArea: </strong>A step area chart combines the features of a step chart and an area chart. Like a step chart, it connects data points with steps rather than straight lines. The area between the steps and the x-axis is filled in, emphasizing the magnitude of the changes. The filled areas help you quickly grasp the overall volume or magnitude of the data, making it easier to see how changes accumulate over a period.</p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p><strong>Scatter Chart:</strong> A scatter chart plots individual data points based on two variables, displaying them as dots. It’s especially useful for identifying relationships or correlations between variables, trends, and outliers.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><img height="504" src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Sept 2024 Release SS/Team Kingfisher/Chart Types.gif" width="1018" /></p>
  <h3 id="3.3">[E] Data Types</h3>
  <p> Data Type includes a Time Series and Duration Curve data types. These data types are crucial in charting for providing insights into time-dependent behavior and the distribution of values, enabling better decision-making and strategic planning.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li><strong>Time Series:</strong> Time series data consists of sequences of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. It is essential for tracking trends, patterns, and behaviors over time. It helps customers analyze how a variable changes over time, enabling them to forecast future trends, identify seasonal patterns, and detect anomalies.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Duration Curve: </strong>In the Duration Curve, the data points are sorted in descending order of magnitude, and the curve shows the percentage of time that the variable exceeds a certain level. Duration curves are particularly useful for assessing the reliability or availability of resources. For example, in energy management, a duration curve can show the percentage of time a power plant operates at a certain capacity. This helps you understand the distribution and likelihood of different levels of performance or resource availability, aiding in resource planning and risk management.  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="5">Drop Zeros from the Data Grid</h2>
  <p>We have provided a check box to hide values that are entirely zero for any of the Properties selected. This will not return the Property whose value is zero for the entire horizon. <br />
    <br />
    For example, let&#39;s assume you have a 7-day run generation with values of 0,0,0,0,0,0, and you clicked the checkbox, <strong>Drop Zeroes</strong>, then that property will not be returned in the response. However, if even a single day has a non-zero value (e.g., 0,0,0,0,2,0), the property will be displayed in the grid with all zeroes except for the one day with a value of 2.<br />
    <br />
    To apply this in your output data grid page, check the box for <strong>Drop Zeros.</strong>

  <h2 id="6">Query Multiple Samples and Time Slices from the Output Data Grid</h2>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You can  query the output for multiple Samples or Time Slices at once from the Output Data Grid page. To support this, the Output Data Grid page  has the option to select Samples or Time Slices in bulk. Once you click on <strong>APPLY</strong>, all the selected Samples or Time Slices will have their results displayed. Thus, saving the time and effort to query each time for different samples. This option is accessible with Monte Carlo and Auto Samples Simulation types. For single runs, the Sample option will be disabled and default to ‘Mean’, and Time Slice will default to ‘All Periods’.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Time Slice drop-down will only be displayed for Studies in which the Time Slice object is configured in the PLEXOS desktop.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To access multi-select Option –</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>1. Go to a <strong>Solution</strong></p>
  <p>2. Navigate to the <strong>Grid View</strong></p>
  <p>3. Select the required Objects and Properties from the Properties Panel and click <strong>APPLY</strong>.</p>
  <p>4. For selecting multiple Samples, click the<strong> Sample drop-down</strong>.</p>
  <p>5. Choose the Samples and click <strong>APPLY</strong>.</p>
