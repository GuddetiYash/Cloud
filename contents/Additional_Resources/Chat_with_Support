  <h2 id="1">Overview</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Chat with Support</strong> feature provides users with a seamless and immediate connection to Energy Exemplar&#39;s live Support Analysts for immediate or non-immediate issues within the PLEXOS Cloud Interface. This feature aims to enhance the user experience by offering an additional channel for users to receive immediate help when needed while navigating within the PLEXOS Cloud interface. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Users can utilize the Chat with Support icon, available at the bottom-right of the PLEXOS Cloud interface, to connect with Energy Exemplar&#39;s Support Analysts and obtain answers to their questions or resolve their issues through a real-time interactive live Chat session. </p>

  <p>The Chat with Support icon is visible to users only when Energy Exemplar Support Analysts are online. If all Support Analysts are offline or busy, users will not be able to view the Chat with Support icon in the user interface. Our Support Analysts are available for 24x5 working days during global business hours. However, during weekends, the Chat with Support icon will not be visible in the User interface. </p>
  <p><br />
    If the Analyst determines that the issue is more complex or requires further investigation, the chat session will conclude with the creation and submission of a case via Energy Exemplar’s Standard Ticketing Process.</p>

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p>Once you click on the <strong>START CHAT</strong> button, you will either be given the Queue number if all our Support Analysts are busy, or you will enter the conversation with our available Support Analyst, where you can begin the conversation to receive assistance for your queries. Upon initiating the Chat request, for each Chat request, the system automatically creates a support ticket, and you will be notified with the ticket number via email. <br />
        Example of the waiting queue:<br />

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p>You can also transfer files or screenshots to assist with your query. The file transfer icon will only be visible once our Support Analysts request a file. To transfer any file, you can ask our Support Analysts to grant file access. Upon enabling, you will see the file transfer option and can transfer files up to 5 MB. <br />
