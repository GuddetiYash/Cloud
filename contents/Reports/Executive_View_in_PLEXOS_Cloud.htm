  <h2 id="1one">Overview</h2>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Executive View is included in the <strong>Analytics </strong>bundle of PLEXOS Cloud.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A new feature has been introduced in PLEXOS Cloud called <strong>Executive View</strong>, which offers a user-friendly interface specifically tailored for managers and executives. This interface allows decision-makers to conveniently review reports that are shared by Analysts within their tenant.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Executive View provides Analysts with a way to collaborate with the Executives within their Tenant and get their feedback. This way they can focus more on modeling and take help from Executives on important decisions. By utilizing this, Analysts can now simplify the process of manipulating the output and directly share it with decision-makers. With just a few clicks, analysts can efficiently share their work.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h4>There are two distinct flows for the Executive View – Publish and View.</h4>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>In the Publish Flow, users with an Analyst license type (Analytics Bundle) can publish their work specifically for decision-makers (Executives).</li>
    <br />
    <li>The View Flow presents Reports shared by Analysts, which are accessible by Executives, Reviewers, and Analysts that they can utilize to evaluate views and make informed decisions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h2 id="2two">Publish Flow</h2>
  <p><br />
    Under this flow, Analysts can create Executive Views that can be shared with the users within their tenant. To create the Executive View, follow the steps mentioned below:  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>In PLEXOS Cloud, navigate to the <strong>Overview </strong>tab and click on the <strong>CREATE EXECUTIVE VIEW</strong> button.</p>
       
      <p><img height="342" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/CreateExView.png" width="782" /></p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p>You will be re-directed to the <strong>Publish View</strong> wizard.</p>
       
      <p><img height="395" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/PublishView.png" width="787" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Search for or select the <strong>Model</strong> whose Reports Analysts want to share as Views. They will only be able to see Models that have Solutions added to BI. Choose the Model that Analysts wish to share as Views, either by searching or selecting. They will have visibility only to the Models that have Solutions added to BI.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Select the desired<strong> BI Report(s)</strong> you would like to share with the users.
      <p><img height="260" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/SelectBIReport.png" width="789" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Before you share the Reports with the users, a preview is provided to understand how the Reports would be presented in the Executive View when shared as Views. </p>
      <p>At this step, you can select or deselect multiple models with their own Reports.<br />
        <br />
        <img height="444" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/PreviewGif.gif" width="789" />
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can rearrange the order of the Reports tab, simply click on the Report tab label and drag it to rearrange the order as desired to view the Reports. Once you&#39;ve completed the reordering, the tab will automatically be selected, allowing you to easily interact with your Reports.<br />
        <br />
        <img height="405" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/Executive view_tab reordering_.gif" width="790" /><br />
        <br />
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> The Tab Reordering functionality is available in both the <strong>Publish </strong>and <strong>View </strong>flow of the Executive View. Please note that any changes made to the Tab Reorder within these Reports will only apply to the user(s) who makes the changes. Additionally, if a user refreshes the page, logs out, or closes the browser tab, the tab reordering and closure settings will reset to their default state.<br />
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In the preview, you can adjust the date range and select the type of Generator, Category, Fuel Type, and Region to view in the report. Refer to the GIF below for a graphical representation. Once checked, click on the <strong>NEXT </strong>button to proceed.</p>
      <p><img height="547" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/PreviewImage.png" width="784" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Clicking on the NEXT button in the above step will prompt you to provide a custom name and description for the Report which will be shown to the users. Click on the <strong>NEXT</strong> button once done.  </p>
      <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Report Name and Description are optional, the analyst can either choose a desired name (should not exceed 60 characters limit) and write a description (1000 characters limit) or go with the system-generated name. </p>
       
      <p><img height="379" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/ViewDesc.png" width="786" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Clicking on the <strong>NEXT</strong> button will redirect you to the <strong>Review and Share View</strong> tab. Under View Details, Enter a unique name ( 60 characters limit) for View. Here View name is a mandatory input. You are also prompted to add a View Description (1000 characters limit), but this is an optional step. <br />

      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can either edit the Report Information on the Add Report Information tab when creating a Report.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Now, once the selected Reports are confirmed click on the <strong>Select Executive</strong> dropdown to share the Report with the decision makers (Executives, Analysts, or Reviewers within the same Tenant. )</p>
       
      <p><img height="331" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/ShareWithUsers.png" width="830" /></p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <p>Once the users are selected Click <strong>SHARE WITH SELECTED USERS</strong> to share the View.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

  <p> </p>
  <p><img height="498" src="../assets/images/ExecutiveViewSS/ViewFlowdashboard.png" width="973" /></p>
  <p> </p>

The Study Overview page contains a new Views tab which displays a complete list of all the Executive Views published for the Study . View management allows users to better manage already shared Views and provide more control to perform further actions on Views. From Actions menu, the already published Views can be deleted from the list. </p>
  <p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Reviewers<b> </b>can also access the View Management Grid, providing them visibility into existing Views.

  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>b) Edit:</strong></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The &quot;Edit&quot; action opens a wizard for the selected view. With Edit, users can update the following fields: Report Name, Report Description, View Name, View Description and update the list of shared users. It is important to note that, under specific circumstances, such as when a user unpublishes a Solution used in a View or deletes an original BI Report, some of the Reports may become unavailable within that View. When this scenario arises, a popup/dialogue will appear informing the user about the unavailability of the reports, then they can proceed with the Edit action by clicking <b>CONTINUE WITH EDIT</b>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img height="421" src="../assets/images/RN_2023/October 2023/Reports Unavailable.png" style="padding: 17px;" width="553" /></p>
  <p><strong>b) Save As (Copy)</strong>:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When clicked, the action &quot;Save As (Copy)&quot; launches the wizard with the latest published Solutions for the Study in the existing View template.  A new View will be created with the name &#39;copy of previous name.&#39; (This name can be changed.)</p>
  <p>This new View includes all previously selected reports and details from the source View, along with the list of pre-populated users. Analysts  have the flexibility to edit any of the pre-populated fields according to their requirements.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img height="194" src="../assets/images/RN_2023/October 2023/ViewActionMenu.png" style="padding: 21px;" width="222" /></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
  <p><strong></strong><br />
    The View Management grid has been updated to sort entries by “Created On” field, ensuring that the most recently shared View is displayed at the top of the list.<br />
    Please note that the &#39;Edit&#39; and &#39;Save As&#39; options are exclusively available for new Views only. These options will be disabled for the Views created before this release. </p>
  <h2 id="5five">Executive View UI Enhancements</h2>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bookmark a View URL</strong>: With this feature, you can now bookmark a View URL in your browser. When you revisit the bookmarked URL, it will automatically display the most recently published View as the default View .</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Created On</strong>: Now the “Created on” Date of a published View will show the Timestamp along with the Date when the View was created.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Enhanced Solution Visibility for Analysts</strong>: Analysts can now see the Solution added to BI for the selected Model and Report during the publishing process.<br />
      This ensures that users are aware of the solution being used to load the report and minimizes the risk of sharing the wrong report. Currently, users can only see the solution name used; they cannot select the desired Solution.</li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Show or Hide the Analyst’s name that Created the Executive View:  </strong>
      <p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Analysts now have the option to hide the &#39;View Created By&#39; field from users accessing the View, allowing users to concentrate more on the content rather than additional details. While these details will still be recorded and displayed in the View Management Grid, by default they will remain hidden from users accessing the View from the simplified Executive View interface. </span></span></span></p>
