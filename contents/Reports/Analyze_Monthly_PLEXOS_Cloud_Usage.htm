  <h1>Analyze Monthly PLEXOS Cloud Usage</h1>
  <p>Stay ahead of the curve as a PLEXOS Cloud Admin with our latest Cloud Usage Summary feature. Each month, Cloud Admins will receive a PLEXOS Cloud Usage Summary email, which shows an in-depth analysis of the PLEXOS Cloud application&#39;s usage for their Tenant.  This email provides Admins  with crucial insights into the application&#39;s monthly activities, tailored separately for Credit Based and Core Based customers. Analyzing these details enables Admins to stay fully informed about what&#39;s happening within the platform to make informed decisions and take any necessary actions to optimize performance and efficiency .<br />
    <br />
    The Admins will receive this email on the 3rd day of each month covering the PLEXOS Cloud usage summary for the previous month, spanning from the first to the last day. While Admins cannot change this schedule, they have the flexibility to manage this email notification under the<strong> Preferences &gt; Email Preferences &gt; Others</strong> section. <br />
    <br />
    By default, the toggle is enabled to receive monthly PLEXOS Cloud Usage email, but Admins can disable the toggle if needed.
