  <h1>Analytics Bundle</h1>
  <p>The Analytics Bundle is designed to provide users with enhanced features for a deeper understanding of their output data. With the Analytics Bundle, along with the ability to run the Simulations users also gain access to analyze the output on deeper level with Map Visualizations, ad hoc queries (Charts, Grid, Reports), the Excel-AddIn (for editing input data, and analyzing output data), powerful BI Analytics capabilities, Event Detection for advanced Reporting and dashboarding in PLEXOS Cloud.<br />
    Analytics Bundle unlocks the full potential of the BI Analytics reporting feature.  BI Analytics is exclusively available with the PLEXOS Cloud platform and cannot be added to standalone PLEXOS desktop or PLEXOS Cloud Workspace opportunities. It is a unique offering to enrich your experience with comprehensive insights.</p>
