  <h1>Marketplace Overview</h1>
  <p><strong>PLEXOS Cloud Marketplace</strong> is a feature that provides a library of content for <strong>PLEXOS Cloud </strong>users. It allows users to access pre-built Excel Add-in templates, BI Reports, Tools section, and Solution Reports that can be easily copied into their tenant. The Marketplace provides users a convenient way to access pre-saved layouts for reports and templates, saving them time and effort in developing their own. Users can browse and search for the Excel add-in templates and reports they need from the Marketplace and quickly and easily copy them into their tenant. New content will continue to be added, so check back frequently.</p>
