  <h2 id="What_is_Congestion_and_Congestion_Analysis?">What is Congestion and Contingent Congestion? </h2>
  <h3><strong>[A] Congestion</strong> </h3>
  <p>Congestion in a power transmission network occurs when the demand for electricity flow through certain transmission lines or network elements exceeds their designed capacity, reaching or surpassing safe operational limits. This situation prevents additional power flows, which could otherwise lead to overloads. Overloads can result in the overheating of wires and transformers or cause operations to enter unstable states.</p>
  <h3><strong>[B] Contingent Congestion</strong></h3>
  <p><strong></strong><strong></strong>Contingent Congestion is a potential increase in congestion that occurs when a specific contingency, such as a line outage or equipment failure, impacts the power supply. You can view and analyze the Contingent Congestion to better understand the implications of various potential contingencies and make more informed decisions to optimize the power performance and reliability.<strong></strong></p>
  <h2><strong></strong></h2>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="What_is Congestion_Analysis?"><strong>What is Congestion Analysis </strong></h2>
  <p>Congestion Analysis is the identification of congestion and the factors that drive it.<br />
    <br />
    Power flows through elements on the network dependent on injections – generation adds power to the network (positive injection) whereas load takes power from the network (negative injection).<br />
    <br />
    Contingencies model the potential losses of transmission elements on the network.  Facilities have a non-zero probability of failure, and the reliable delivery of power must take this into account.  When elements fail, power will be redirected per the physics of the transmission system across the remaining elements.  These remaining elements must remain below acceptable loading levels should a contingency occur.<br />
    <br />
    The map visualizations and output tabulations help the user to identify when and where congestion occurs on the system, while the congestion analysis tools allow the user to identify how both injections and contingencies impact power flow.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="Uses_for_Congestion_Analysis">Uses for Congestion Analysis </h2>
  <p>All generation owners and load entities are exposed to deliverability risk. Congestion drives price differentials prices between locations (i.e., without congestion, prices would be homogenous), and leads to suboptimal economic dispatch.<br />
     <br />
    In regulated markets, congestion leads to higher production costs.  These increased production costs are usually passed on to the rate payer, but the utility has an obligation to reasonably mitigate these costs. In deregulated markets, entities such as asset owners, demand aggregators, and traders need to understand LMP differentials.  Asset owners and demand aggregators will seek to minimize these differentials, whereas traders will want to take an informed position based on these.</p>

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>After the model finishes running successfully, navigate to the <strong>Solutions</strong> page. There are several ways to view the Congestion analysis for your Model from here. You can identify the Model which has the Congestion based on the Congestion icon as shown below in the screenshot.<br />
      <img src="../assets/images/Congestion Analysis in PLEXOS Cloud/New SS - Aug 2024/Congestion Icon.png" />
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>For geocoded studies, navigate to the <strong>Map</strong> tab located in the top right-hand corner of your screen. In the <strong>Property</strong> panel on the left side, under the <strong>Transmission</strong> and <strong>Line</strong> dropdowns, select the <strong>Congestion </strong>property, and then click <strong>Apply.<br />
      </strong><strong></strong><br />
      Refer to the GIF for example:<br />

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Once you click Apply, you can view and select the <strong>Period Type, Sample, Phase, </strong>and <strong>Time Period</strong> on the Map tab. Click on<strong> Output Trend</strong> to view the Congestion for lines. Output Trend displays the <strong>Congestion ($/MW) </strong>across the selected interval.<br />
      <img height="424" src="../assets/images/Congestion Analysis in PLEXOS Cloud/New SS - Aug 2024/Output Trend.png" width="860" />
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>If you click on a time period where there is Congestion in the system on the Output Trend chart, PLEXOS Cloud will show you which lines in the system are congested.<br />
      <br />
      In this example, if you select the point on 12 May 2023, you can see that <strong>Line North_West_115 </strong>has <strong>$7.34/MW</strong> and <strong>Line East_North_115</strong> has <strong>$5.31/MW</strong> of Congestion. To drill down further, click on the line (shown below in red).<br />

  <h2 id="Understanding the Different Reports">Understanding the Different Reports </h2>
  <h3><strong>[A] Induced Flow Decomposition </strong></h3>
  <p>Induced Flow Decomposition details how the different injections (generation or load) at identified buses contribute to the flow on the transmission element being inspected. The characteristics of each injection (capacity, load, and PTDF) are displayed for the specified interval.<br />
     </p>
  <h3><strong>[B] Congestion Charge Decomposition </strong></h3>
  <p>This report allows users to understand the financial impact marginal cost of congestion at each node of interest.  </p>
  <p><br />
    The LMP of a given node is the sum of the marginal cost of energy, marginal cost of losses, and the marginal cost of congestion.  The congestion charge decomposition report identifies the congestion charge at the given node for each congested element in the system, allowing the user to identify which congested elements are most impactful.<br />
     </p>
  <h3><strong>[C] Node Flow Report </strong></h3>
  <p>The node flow report allows the user to see all flows in and out of a given node.  It reports all injections (generation and demand) as well as detailing flows through lines or transformers, allowing the user to quickly see how power is distributed at that node. </p>
