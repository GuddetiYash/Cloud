    <li>Set the Windows environment variables for the PLEXOS Cloud Toolkit (CLI)</li>
    <li>Login to PLEXOS Cloud from PLEXOS desktop</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="4"><br />
    <strong>Installing PLEXOS 9.1 R03 or Later</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>Download and install <strong>PLEXOS 9.1 R03</strong> from <a href="https://portal.energyexemplar.com/">https://portal.energyexemplar.com/ </a></p>
  <h2 id="5">Installing the PLEXOS Cloud Toolkit (CLI) from PLEXOS Cloud</h2>
  <p>PLEXOS Desktop uses the PLEXOS Cloud Toolkit (also known as the PLEXOS Cloud Command Line Interface or CLI) for communication with the cloud. This Toolkit is also useful for integration and automation activities. It is easy to use and does not require programming experience. Learn More about <a href="file:///articles/KB_Article/Introduction-to-PLEXOS-Cloud-CLI">Introduction to PLEXOS Cloud CLI</a>.<br />
    <br />
    Follow the steps below to download and install the CLI:<br />
     
  </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Login to PLEXOS Cloud<br />
    <br />

  </div>
  <h2 id="6"><strong><br />
      Setting the Windows Environment Variables for the PLEXOS Cloud Toolkit (CLI)</strong></h2>
  <p>PLEXOS triggers the CLI to run commands in PLEXOS Cloud. A Windows environment variable, the Path, needs to be set to allow PLEXOS to trigger those CLI commands regardless of the install location on your machine. To do this you need to set the Path Environment Variable.<br />
     </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. From the Windows Search bar enter &quot;Settings&quot; to open the <strong>Windows Settings</strong> screen. Alternatively, you can go to Windows Explorer, right click and click Properties.<br />
    <br />
    2. On the Settings screen enter &quot;environment variables&quot; in the Settings Search and select <strong>Edit the system environment variables.</strong><br />
    <br />
    <img height="283" src="../assets/images/image20.png" width="265" /> 
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    3. A System Properties dialog will appear, click on the<strong> Environment Variables</strong> button. <br />
    <br />
    4. From the Environment Variables screen, select Path from the User Variables section and click <strong>Edit</strong>. Alternatively, if multiple users leverage the same machine you can edit the System Variable for Path below.<br />
    <br />
    <img height="371" src="../assets/images/image21.png" width="334" />
  </div>

    5. Click <strong>New </strong>to create environment variable.<br />
    <br />
    <img height="347" src="../assets/images/image22.png" width="311" />
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    6. Paste the path where you installed the CLI from the previous major step, then Click <strong>OK.</strong><br />
    <br />
    <img height="372" src="../assets/images/image23.png" width="331" />
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    7. Click <strong>OK </strong>to exit out of the Windows Settings screen.<br />
    <br />
    8. You can test that this worked by opening a Command Prompt and entering &quot;plexos-cloud&quot;.

    <strong>b.</strong>  See the <a href="#CLIref"><strong>Install the PLEXOS Cloud Toolkit (CLI) from PLEXOS Cloud</strong></a> heading above for Download and Installation steps and continue below steps after step 5.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>c.</strong>  In the Destination Folder dialog, while installing PLEXOS Cloud CLI, change the folder path to Program Files Folder (Recommended) or to a folder where every user has access to it (Public).<br />
    <br />
    For example, C:\ProgramFiles\
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img height="242" src="../assets/images/image25.png" width="306" /></div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    <strong>d.</strong>  Create a .txt file in the folder (plexos-cloud-location.txt) and paste the file path of the installed plexos-cloud.exe in the .txt file.<br />
     
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img height="82" src="../assets/images/image27.png" width="293" /></div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    <strong>e.</strong>  Copy the .txt file and paste it into the other users (who do not have admin access) directory at C:\Users\Username\EnergyExemplar<br />
     
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img height="122" src="../assets/images/image28.png" width="381" /></div>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
    <strong>f. </strong> A non-admin user can now open the PLEXOS Desktop to Cloud integration (9.1 R03 and above) and Load a Study to successfully see the changes.<br />
     
  </div>
  <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img height="75" src="../assets/images/image30.png" width="653" /></div>
  <p><br />
    3. Select the required environment from the list. The environment is the region where your PLEXOS Cloud environment is hosted. You can validate this from the URL you use to login- <strong>North America (NA), Europe (EU), Australia (AU)</strong>. The <strong>Other </strong>is for Energy Exemplar employees.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>NOTE: </strong>The PLEXOS Cloud Sign-In panel may show up on the left side of the screen, just Pin the panel so it will stay on the right side of the screen. <br />

  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>5.  If your email has access to multiple tenants within a single environment, you will get redirected to the <strong>Select a tenant to continue</strong> page. Users who belong to a single tenant will be logged in to their respective tenant without being prompted to select a tenant. </p>
  <p><br />
    6.  By default, the <a class="glossterm" data-glossterm="Primary Tenant" href="#">Primary Tenant</a> is selected but you can select the desired Tenant from the list and click on the <strong>CONTINUE </strong>button.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>When an Admin creates a user and assigns their initial tenant, it will be designated as the Primary Tenant. The user will only see the &quot;Primary&quot; tag associated with this tenant&#39;s name. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>      <img height="326" src="../assets/images/PLEXOS Cloud Integration with PLEXOS Desktop/Select different tenant page.png" width="686" /><br />
    <br />
    7. After successful authentication, you will get logged in for the selected tenant. You are now ready to use PLEXOS and PLEXOS Cloud together.
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><b>NOTE</b>: After you Sign In successfully, your name will display in place of the Sign In button in the upper right section of the screen.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>8.  If a user needs to change the tenant after logging in to the PLEXOS Desktop, they can either change the tenant from PLEXOS Cloud (without Signing out) or can sign out and sign in again within PLEXOS Desktop, to access the tenant selection page.<br />

      <img height="472" src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Clone to Desktop option.png" width="518" /></strong><br />
    <br />
    2.  A Clone Study pop-up displays with the following caution message (Before selecting a folder to clone the Study):<br />
    <br />
    <strong>“For better results, avoid saving to shared drives or OneDrive. Please choose a local drive to prevent potential sync issues.”</strong>
  </p>
  <p>      <img src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Caution message for Clone Study.png" /></p>
  <p>If you proceed and select a folder within OneDrive or a shared drive, the caution changes to a warning message as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>“It looks like the selected drive is OneDrive. Cloning studies from Cloud to OneDrive may result in sync issues and other unexpected errors. Please select a local drive before cloning to avoid any issues.”</strong><br />
    <br />
          <img src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Warning message for Clone Study.png" />
  </p>
  <p>This warning disables the Clone to Desktop button, requiring you to select a local drive before proceeding.</p>
  <p><br />
    3.  Select the destination folder where you want to store the Study.<br />
    <br />
    4.  The Study Cloning process will start. This process may take several minutes, depending on the size of the Study, and the progress is indicated in the Application Status Bar at the bottom left of the screen.<br />
    <br />
    5.  After cloning is complete, the cloned Study will open automatically on PLEXOS Desktop as shown below:<br />
    <br />
          <img src="../assets/images/image34.png" />
  </p>
  <h2 id="10"><br />
    Saving a Study to PLEXOS Cloud</h2>
  <p>A PLEXOS database that has been saved to PLEXOS Cloud is known as a Study. The following video covers the process of uploading (saving) a Study to PLEXOS Cloud from PLEXOS Desktop:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="380" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/896775630?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="660" style="cursor: nesw-resize;"></iframe></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <div>1. Click the <b>Open </b>button to browse and open a local PLEXOS database.<br />
     </div>
  <div><strong>NOTE:</strong> Cloud Study doesn&#39;t upload .txt files. Only .csv files are supported on the cloud. If your .txt files contain comma-separated values, you could simply rename the files to .csv extension. Another option is to open the .txt in Excel by setting the right delimiter, and then <strong>Save As</strong> the file into .csv format.</div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>2. Check the Status of your Study,  in the bottom left corner of the screen. If the local database has not been saved or synced to PLEXOS Cloud it will show an Offline state.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> It is best practice to have every XML Study stored in its own folder from which you are uploading your study to Cloud.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> Using network drives are not supported for syncing with PLEXOS
    <p>Cloud. Network drives perform much slower than local drives. Additionally sharing a study on a network drive among multiple users for collaboration purposes will cause conflicts with versioning.</p>
  </div>
  <div> </div>
  <div>
    <p>3.  Known Limitations for Saving Study from PLEXOS Desktop to PLEXOS Cloud are as follows:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul class="Disc">
      <li><strong>Creating/Adding New Study:</strong> Uncompressed study size of up to 12 GB is supported. </li>
      <li><strong>Creating/uploading a new version:</strong><br />
         
        <ul>
          <li><strong>XML Changes:</strong> 500,000   records (there should not be more than 500,000 changes in the XML. By changes, includes add, removes &amp; modifies.)</li>
          <li><strong>CSV/TimeSeries:</strong> No more than 3 GB of total timeseries changes can be pushed. For example, if 5 files change, the sum of their change (diff) size should not be more than 3 GB.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p lwc-ocu6ikr8h3=""><span><span><span>For Model Names w</span></span></span>e allow only the characters as below in the Model Names:</p>
        <p lwc-ocu6ikr8h3=""> </p>
        <ul>
          <li lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">Alphabets<span> </span><strong lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">A-Z, a-z</strong></li>
          <li lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">Numbers<span> </span><strong lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">0-9</strong></li>
          <li lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">brackets<span> </span><strong lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">( )</strong></li>
          <li lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">Underscore<strong lwc-ocu6ikr8h3=""><span> </span>_</strong></li>
          <li lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">Hyphen<span> </span><strong lwc-ocu6ikr8h3="">-</strong><br />
            <span><br />
              Any characters other than above will get converted to dot &quot;.&quot;  For example, If you enter = or $ in your Model Name, it will automatically changes to &quot;.&quot; Any Leading or Trailing white spaces in Model names will be trimmed.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </div>
  <div>4. Click on the <b>Save</b> dropdown and select the <b>Save Study to PLEXOS Cloud </b>option. It will upload your Study to PLEXOS Cloud.<br />
    <br />
    <img height="304" src="../assets/images/image35.png" width="295" />
  </div>
  <div><br />
    <strong>NOTE: </strong>Before you save a Study to the PLEXOS Cloud, you will see a warning pop-up as shown below. Also, you can edit the Study Name per your requirement in this pop-up:<br />
    <br />
    <img height="198" src="../assets/images/image36.png" width="318" />
    <p><strong>A. Caution Messages for New Study Saved on Shared Drive or One Drive</strong><br />
      <br />
      You will notice a caution message if the Study is currently saved on a Shared drive or OneDrive. In this scenario, the Create Study on Cloud button remains enabled but prompts you to move the Study to a local drive if it is saved on a Network or Shared Drive to prevent possible issues.

    </h2>
  </div>
  <p>With the 10.0 R02 release of PLEXOS Desktop, users can access and manage the Version History and Simulation data for their Cloud Studies directly from PLEXOS Desktop. The Version History panel provides a dedicated side panel for Study Version Management, offering users a clear overview of the Study&#39;s current status and its change history. The Version History is shown in a timeline, providing users with visibility of the project&#39;s history. Users can conveniently pin the side panel to the PLEXOS display, ensuring it remains visible during editing sessions, enabling seamless Push of changes as they work, and being notified when collaborators on Cloud have made new changes.<br />

  <div style="margin-bottom: 11px;">
    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li><strong>Unwanted removes in cloud study after subsequent push</strong>
        <p>This issue can occur due to the following reasons:</p>
        <p><strong>A. Synchronization Process </strong><br />
          During the synchronization process between PLEXOS Desktop and the PLEXOS Cloud, when you execute the Pull Changes command, if updates are pulled from the PLEXOS Cloud into the input XML (database) file, the PLEXOS Desktop application prompts you to reopen the file to apply the changes.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../assets/images/PLEXOS Cloud Integration with PLEXOS Desktop/Syncronization process.png" />
        </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If the Ignore option is selected instead of reopening the file and the XML file is subsequently saved, the changes pulled from the PLEXOS Cloud are not retained.<br />
           <br />
          On the next Push operation, these lost changes are shown as Removed on the version history page. For instance, changes from version 39 may appear as removed in version 40.<br />
           <br />
          This behaviour can be configured in the PLEXOS Desktop settings to align with your workflow and prevent change loss during sync operations.<br />
          <br />
          <img src="../assets/images/PLEXOS Cloud Integration with PLEXOS Desktop/Sync process.png" />
        </p>
        <p><br />
          <strong>B. Version Mismatch</strong><br />
          If team members are not using the same PLEXOS version for a project or study, discrepancies can arise. Version upgrades or downgrades often alter IDs in the XML file, which results in additional removals and additions during changeset creation.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom: 11px;"> 
    <h3>Simulations tab</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Simulations</strong> tab allows users to view Simulation lists and download Solutions or Solution Log Files directly from the PLEXOS Desktop. The Simulations tab provides easy access to Simulation-related data in one place and a Refresh button to fetch the updated Simulation data. It includes the following columns to provide users with all the Simulation information for the currently selected Study:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul class="Disc">
      <li><strong>Model Name</strong> - Shows the list of all executed Simulations. </li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> - Shows the state of the Simulation upon completion, categorized as Successful, Failed, Cancelled, or Completed with Error.</li>
      <li><strong>Started</strong> - Shows the start date and time of the Simulation execution.  </li>
      <li><strong>User</strong> - Shows the name of the user who executed the Simulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Actions</strong> - Allow users to Download the Solution File, Log File, and View in Cloud option for each Simulation.</li>

  <p id="" style="left: 100px;top: 3389.5px;"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Very large uploads can experience performance issues during the initial upload or creation of a study in PLEXOS Cloud. This is because larger files require more time to upload and the process can strain the system&#39;s resources. To avoid such situations files above 10 GB are not supported by PLEXOS Cloud, attempting to upload them is likely to fail.</p>

  <h2 style="left: 100px; top: 3389.5px;">Troubleshooting PLEXOS Desktop (Log Files)</h2>
  <p>The new centralized log collection feature consolidates essential log files and configuration data into a single, user-defined location on your machine to streamline diagnostics and support for the PLEXOS Desktop. This enhancement simplifies log management and facilitates ease of access and share for support resolution.<br />
    <br />
    <img src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Centralized log files.png" />
  </p>
  <p>Previously scattered across multiple directories, log files for PLEXOS Desktop, Central License Manager, and CLI are now automatically stored in a single, user defined folder, making retrieval straightforward.<br />
           </p>
  <p>To define the destination folder for centralized log collection, run the following command in Command Prompt:</p>
  <p><strong>     pxc environment diagnostic-information -d &quot;Folder path where the Log Files will be stored&quot;</strong><br />
    <br />
    <img height="143" src="../assets/images/RN_2024/Nov 2024 Release SS/Flamingo/Log files collection comand.png" width="736" />
  </p>
  <p>Upon completion, a confirmation message will appear. Logs are saved in the &quot;PLEXOS-Logs-&lt;Date of Collection&gt;&quot; folder for easy access.</p>
