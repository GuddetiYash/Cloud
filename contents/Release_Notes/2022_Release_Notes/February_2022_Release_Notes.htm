    For more detailed descriptions of the improvements available in the February release, scroll through the topics below.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2 id="1one">View a Summary of a Study (Study Overview)  </h2>
  <p>The new Study Overview page shows key information for all models within the selected study, it provides an at-a-glance view that allows you to see progress and version changes and quickly navigate to Model or Solution.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The key components of the workspace are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4><b>View of key metrics:</b></h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This section shows key metrics of the study along with the description at the top that allows you to communicate the key goals of the study to other users.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/February 1.jpg" /><br />
     </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4><b>Creator and Member section:</b></h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">This section shows who created the Study and who all have access to the Study.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4><b>Permission/Access to Study:</b></h4>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Permission to different features in a Study is determined by the user’s license in the system. A Modeler has full permission to a Study they are a member of, while a Report Viewer can only view Reports of the Study.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You can add members to access your study by clicking on <b>MANAGE TEAM.</b></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/February 2.jpg" /><br />
     </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3><b>Study Overview</b></h3>
  <p><b>Models:</b></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The first tab of the Study Overview page shows a list of all Models in the study, number of simulations that have been run for the model along with which user ran it last, and on what date. The Run Horizon is also shown along with a RUN button.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/February 3.jpg" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" /><br />
    This allows you to run the Model directly from the Overview page. You can only select and run one Model at a time. To run models in sequence please use the Models Workspace.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>You can also apply sorting and filtering to each of the columns.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/February 4.jpg" /><br />
     </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><b>Version History</b></h2>
  <p>The<b> Version History</b> tab shows the list of all changes made to any object settings in the study. This view is similar to the one in Cloud Bridge.<br />
    <br />
    <img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/Version History 1.jpg" /><br />
     
  </p>
  <p>The list by default is grouped by date, it can also be grouped by a member. You can also sort the list by clicking the down arrow.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><br />
    <img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/Version History 2.jpg" /><br />
    <br />
    Each version shows data as per the changes all the users have made, such as Adds, Edits, Removes, and Timeseries.
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>‘Adds’ shows number of models added to the study.</li>
    <li>&#39;Edits’ shows number of models that have some edits.</li>

  <h2 id="2two">Study Level Permissions   </h2>
  <p>A new level of access and security are available now in PLEXOS Cloud Feb 2022 release. When you upload a study through Cloud Bridge, it is now private and no one else can see it in PLEXOS Cloud. Only the creator can add other users as members of the Team and give them access to the study in PLEXOS Cloud interface, Cloud Bridge and Excel Plugin.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This means when you upload a Study through Cloud Bridge, it will be private, and no one else can see it in PLEXOS Cloud. Further, you can add other users as team members and grant them access to your study. The level of access is determined by the user’s license.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><img src="../../assets/images/RN_2022/February/Study Level 1.jpg" /><br />
     </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><a class="rn_button" href="../../Admin/Study_Level_Permission.htm" target="_blank">Learn more about Study Level Permissions</a><br />
     </p>
  <h2 id="3three">Access Another User’s Study through Cloud Bridge and the MS Excel Plugin</h2>
  <p>This feature is related to Study Level Permission. This ensures If you have permission to a Study, you can now access and download it from Cloud Bridge even if you haven’t originally uploaded it. This also means a user can view input and output data from a Study they didn’t upload using the Microsoft Excel Plugin (Beta). Note: Only users with a Modeler license have access to Cloud Bridge and the MS Excel Plugin.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2 id="6Six">Support for Hidden Parameters and Solver Tuner Files</h2>
  <p>Studies uploaded through Cloud Bridge and Simulations run on PLEXOS Cloud now support hidden parameters and solver tuner files. Now, you will be able to edit the &quot;Undoc param files&quot; (Hidden Parameter and Solver Tuner files) in PLEXOS on your desktop and can push the change using Cloud Bridge via Study Creation process (as initial upload) as well as versioning process.</p>

     </p>
  <p>We are making it more convenient than ever to review Studies and collaborate through all PLEXOS and PLEXOS Cloud channels. It&#39;s also a great way to segment Studies and keep data confidential. We hope you’ll find the new Study Overview and Study-Level Permission page an easier way to quickly see key metrics, study progress, and version changes for all Models.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2 id="7Seven">Additional Bug Fixes and improvements</h2>
  <p>We have continued to fix bugs affecting user experience, stability, and performance, including fixes related to Cloud Bridge. Additionally, we have hidden the <b>RUN</b> button for in-progress Simulation on the Solutions page, added other usability enhancements in Cloud Bridge, and improved the PLEXOS Cloud user interface.</p>
