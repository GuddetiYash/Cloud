  <h2 id="1one">PLEXOS Cloud Marketplace</h2>
  <p>The PLEXOS Cloud Marketplace is a new feature that provides a library of content for users. It allows users to access pre-built Excel Add-in templates, BI Reports and Solution Reports that can be easily copied into their own tenant.</p>
  <p><br/>
    The Marketplace provides users with a convenient way to access pre-saved layouts for reports and templates, saving them time and effort in developing their own. New content will continue to be added, so make sure to check back frequently.</p>

  <h2>Administration (Simulation Management and Storage Management) </h2>
  <h3>Renaming the Admin Study Management<strong> </strong>tab to Storage Management </h3>
  <p>We have renamed the “Study Management” tab as “Storage Management”. This change was made to better align the tab name with its actual function.</p>
  <p><br/>
    Please note that this change only affects the name of the tab, and all of the features and functionalities within the tab remain the same.<br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="Storage Management" height="363" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/April/Storage Management.jpg" width="781"/>
  </p>
  <h3><br/>
    Export Storage Data for Studies and Solutions</h3>
  <div>We added a new Export icon in the <strong>Admin &gt; Storage Management</strong> tab (Above the Action column). It allows Admins to export the data from the grid in either &quot;.csv&quot; or &quot;.xlsx&quot; format. It is helpful to get this data to sort filter, group, etc. Also, you can use these data as a backup for future reference or can share it within your internal teams for analytics purposes. <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;border-width: none;border-color: #000000;border-left-width: none;border-left-color: #000000;border-top-width: none;border-top-color: #000000;border-right-width: none;border-right-color: #000000;border-bottom-width: none;border-bottom-color: #000000"><img alt="" border="0" src="../../assets/images/Blue_Book_Closed.gif" style="border: none;"/> </span>NOTE</strong>: You must switch between the Studies and Solutions tab to export data for each type of data.
  </div>

  </p>
  <h3><br/>
    Select more Studies and Solution at once in Storage Management tab </h3>
  <p>We have enhanced the Storage Management tab to allow Administrators to select up to 10 records (Studies or Solutions) at a time to perform bulk Archive, Unarchive, and Delete actions. This is done to save your time in performing bulk operations. Previously, the limit was 5 records at a time. If you exceed the maximum record selection limit, you will see a notification, “Only 10 Studies or Solutions can be selected at a time for any bulk action to be performed”. Refer to the image below for more understanding.<br/>
    <br/>

  </p>
  <h2 id="5five">Integration and Automation - CLI/API</h2>
  <h3>CLI Updates</h3>
  <h4>Improved Output Messaging</h4>
  <p>The Command Line Interface (CLI) now provides clearer output messaging for the study changeset push command. If no changes are found, the CLI will output “Study has no changes to push”. This improves workflows and minimizes confusion if you are working with the most up-to-date version of your model.<br/>
    <br/>
    The study repair-local command attempts to repair the cloud sync of a local study when the data has been corrupted or the study has been moved. If you enter the command, and PLEXOS cannot find your database in the correct file path and there appears to be no corruption, the following message will be output by the CLI: <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>“The local Study folder for Study Id “studyId” was found in location “FilePath”. The Study is an active study in cloud environment and is tied to input project file at location “FilePath”. If study is not working correctly, recommend using the study delete local command and recloning to a new folder, followed by replacing local study data.”</em><br/>
     
  </p>
  <h4>New Options and Filtering Capabilities</h4>
  <p>The <strong>Simulation </strong>list, <strong>Solution</strong> list, and <strong>Study</strong> list commands can now list 1000 records. These commands previously only reported &#39;250&#39; records each, but the new larger number of records presents users with more data that can then be filtered.<br/>
    Two new options have been added to the simulation monitor command:<br/>
    <br/>
    <strong><em>--Raw</em></strong> and <em><strong>--Utilization</strong></em>. The <em><strong>--Raw</strong></em> option allows you to view live updates to the log file, and the <em><strong>--Utilization</strong></em> option updates on resource utilization in addition to outputting the parsed step data.The simulation monitor command previously only supported the <em><strong>--StepData</strong></em> option.<br/>
    <br/>
    In this release, we have also added more flexibility to the &quot;<strong>FileFilter</strong>&quot; property in the SolutionData object by allowing only downloading desired files from a solution into a simulation&#39;s input data. This new feature works by allowing users to specify file name patterns to target only specific sets of matching files. For example, if a CSVOutput.zip file includes multiple folders with large quantities of data, but you only wanted to download the Daily Generator Generation files, you could specify the “FileFilter” as “*Daily/ST Generator*.Generation.csv”. This is especially useful for very large outputs where only a small subset of output files are needed.<br/>
    <br/>

  </p>
  <h3>API Updates</h3>
  <h4>Changes to Parquet Files </h4>
  <p>With this release, the partitioned Data Parquet files will pack multiple “seriesIds” (one or more) within a row group for all new solutions produced.  Earlier, each “seriesId” data was packed in a one-row group. The &quot;info&quot; data will now have “1:N” relation between “seriesId:rowgroupId”, instead of 1:1. <br/>
    <br/>
     
  </p>
  <h2 id="6six">Additional Improvements and Bug Fixes</h2>
  <p>In this release, we have continued to make improvements to the PLEXOS Cloud, with a focus on enhancing the user experience, stability, and performance. <br/>
    <br/>
    As part of these efforts, we have improved the usability of <strong>Solutions Reports</strong> by retaining Report selections when users switch between different Solutions. <br/>
    <br/>
    We have also added horizontal scroll arrows for <strong>KPI Metrics cards</strong> on the <strong>Simulation Management page</strong>, specifically on the tabs mentioned below: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Admin &gt; Simulation Management </li>
    <li>Username &gt; Simulation Management </li>
    <li>Simulations (within a Study)</li>
    <li>Admin &gt; Storage Management tab </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can use these arrows to view hidden metrics cards in the list and can easily navigate to the required metric. <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="Status Bar" height="76" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/April/Status Bar.jpg" width="741"/><br/>
      <br/>
    The <strong>Properties panel</strong> now includes an indeterminate checkbox, which shows a partial selection of both properties and objects. This enhancement allows users to more easily identify which properties have selected fields.<br/>
