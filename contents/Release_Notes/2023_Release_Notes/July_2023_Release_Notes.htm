<p> </p>

  <h2 id="1one">Solution Output Analysis (Map, Grid and Reports) </h2>
  <h3>Customize Icons for Classes and Categories on the Map</h3>
  <p>This new feature provides users the ability to select and customize icons for their Classes and Categories using the Icon Palette.</p>
  <p>  <br/>
    <br/>
    With the new Icon Palette, you are no longer limited to pre-defined or generic icons. Instead, you have the freedom to choose custom icons that align with your preferences and specific needs.

  <h2 id="2two">Model Building and Editing (Desktop Integration and Excel)</h2>
  <h3>Excel Add-In: Add New Categories</h3>
  <p>The Excel Add-In now enables adding a new Category for any Class as required. This will make the data more precise for users and they can see the particular category data as required. Once Saved, these newly created Categories are available in the Category column drop-down for your selection. You can add different Categories to different Objects as required. <br/>
     </p>
  <h3>     <img height="342" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/July/July2023ReleaseSS/Excel Add-In_Add new Category/saved new category in the column.png" width="382"/></h3>

  <h3><br/>
    <br/>
    Tag Properties to Scenarios
  </h3>
  <p>The Excel Add-In now provides support for tagging Scenario Objects to any Property data.<br/>
    The Scenario column in the ClassName{Property} sheet allows user-friendly editing of Scenarios, by providing a drop-down input with the list of available Scenarios.<br/>
    <br/>
    Using the drop-down, the users can browse the available Scenario names and select them, avoiding the need to remember names or accidentally enter an invalid name. Users previously had to enter Scenario Object names manually, so this improvement reduces the required keystrokes for users.<br/>

  <h2 id="3three"><br/>
    Model Execution</h2>
  <h3>Run One or More Models in a Simulation Group</h3>
  <p>Users can now run Models individually within Simulation Groups with this release of PLEXOS Cloud.<br/>
    With this update, when a new Model is added to an existing Simulation Group, there is no longer a need to run the entire group. Instead, you can now execute the Model on its own using the <strong>Actions</strong> menu located in the row for that Model. <br/>
    <br/>
     <img height="278" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/July/July2023ReleaseSS/RunAModel.png" width="684"/><br/>
    <br/>
    This enhancement provides users with greater flexibility and efficiency in their Simulation workflows. You can focus on running a specific Model without the overhead of executing the entire group.  <br/>
    <br/>
    With individual Model execution, you can save time and computational resources by avoiding the need to run all the Models together. 
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Simulation Monitoring Dashboard (Beta Release) </h3>
  <p>The new<strong> Simulation Monitoring Dashboard </strong>feature offers real-time progress updates on the Status, Key metrics, and logs for ongoing Simulations. It provides users with the necessary information to assess whether the Simulation is progressing as anticipated.  </p>

  <h2 id="4four">BI Reports</h2>
  <h3>Enhanced BI Solution Management </h3>
  <p>To manage Solutions added to BI effectively, users now have the option to view a detailed list all Solutions in BI Analytics.  </p>
  <p>This helps the user decide which Solutions to remove when the limit is reached.  </p>
  <p>This allows users to review the list and make informed decisions about which solutions they can remove from BI analytics. <br/>
    <br/>
       <img height="308" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/July/July2023ReleaseSS/BISolutionsList.png" width="640"/><br/>
    <br/>
    Users are restricted from adding or removing a solution when there is already a solution in the &quot;In Progress&quot; state. <br/>
    <br/>
       <img height="283" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/July/July2023ReleaseSS/BISolInProgress.png" width="645"/><br/>
    <br/>
    When the user level limit is reached for adding Solutions to BI, you can refer to the list and remove any unnecessary Solutions to make room for adding a new one.  <br/>
    <br/>
    By checking the list, you will be able to see the total number of Solutions you have added, which will assist in determining how much of your limit remains. <br/>
    <br/>
        <img height="304" src="../../assets/images/RN_2023/July/July2023ReleaseSS/BILimitExceeds.png" width="652"/><br/>
    <br/>
