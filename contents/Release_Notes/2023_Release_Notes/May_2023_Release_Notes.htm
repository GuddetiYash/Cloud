     </p>
  <h2 id="1one">Solution Output Analysis (Map, Grid and Reports)</h2>
  <h3>Enabling Pivot view in Output Data Grid Page (Beta Release) </h3>
  <p>The <strong>Data Grid </strong>page in Solutions now has a <strong>Pivot View</strong> to include customization options for users. Previously, Data Grid supported List, Name, and Property view options. The List View remains, and the Name and Property Views are replaced with the new Pivot View.</p>
  <p> <br />
    <br />
    The Pivot View can be enabled using the <strong>Pivot View Toggle</strong> in the Output Data Grid Page.   <br />
    <br />
    It lets you switch from a list view to a more powerful Pivot View. With Pivot View, you can easily analyze large amounts of data and gain insights that were previously hard to discover. <br />
    <br />
    You can drag and drop columns to the group and aggregate your data.  <br />
    <br />
    For example, you have a dataset that tracks the performance of different power generators across different regions. With Pivot Mode, you can quickly create a Pivot table that shows how generators are performing in different regions and compare their performance against other generators. <br />
    <br />
    For customization in Pivot View, simply click the <strong>Pivot Mode switch</strong> in the Grid toolbar. There is a sidebar that provides options for row grouping and pivoting, allowing for more flexibility and customization. <br />
    <br />
    <br />

  </p>
  <h2 id="6six">Integration and Automation (CLI/API)</h2>
  <h3>New Command for Solution Stitching </h3>
  <p>Solution stitching can now be triggered using the CLI. To start, make sure that the Run Type is set to Distributed and the Distribution Method is set to Monte Carlo in PLEXOS Cloud. After executing the model, the following inputs are required to execute the command: &quot;executionId&quot;, &quot;cores&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;. The command can be entered as shown below: <br />
     </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>pxc simulation solution-stitching --executionId &quot;Parent simulation executionId&quot; --cores &quot;cores&quot; --memory &quot;memory&quot; </em></div>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Triggering Simulation Group Operations Using the CLI</h3>
  <p>A <strong>Simulation Group </strong>is a collection of Simulations that can be run together as a batch. Users can create and edit these groups so that they don&#39;t have to manually select multiple Models each time they want to run them, and can instead simply run a predefined group. <br />
    <br />
    Users can trigger operations related to Simulation Groups using the &quot;<strong>pxc&quot;</strong> study settings command. Currently, the only type enabled in the study settings command is the <strong>SimulationGroup</strong> type. <br />
    <br />
    Users can create, delete, and list Simulation Groups, and add configurations to existing Simulation Groups. Enter the following command in the CLI and you will be directed to the help options available for the command:<br />
     
  </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>pxc study settings -? </em></div>
  <p><br />
    Users can also execute Simulation Groups via the CLI using the command below. The groupId and studyId are required inputs to execute the command.  <br />
     </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>pxc simulation run-group --groupId &quot;groupId&quot; and --studyId &quot;studyId&quot; </em></div>
  <p><br />
    Learn more about Solution Stitching and running Simulation Groups using the CLI in the article <a href="../../CLI/CLI_Toolkit.htm" target="_blank">Introduction to PLEXOS Cloud Toolkit (CLI). </a><br />
     </p>
  <h2 id="7seven">Additional Improvements and Bug Fixes</h2>
  <p>We have continued to make improvements to PLEXOS Cloud, with a focus on enhancing the user experience, stability, and performance. <br />
    <br />
    As part of these efforts, we have improved the usability of <strong>Gurobi Tuner </strong>runs, it now allows users to select a specific phase to optimize (ST, MT, LT, Pasa).  <br />
    <br />
    User Level Limits have been added for publishing BI Solutions. Moving forward, this limit will be applicable to all PLEXOS Cloud users. Each user will now have a maximum limit of &#39;<strong>10</strong>&#39; published Solutions. If you reach your limit, you will see a warning message indicating that you have exhausted your limit. To regain access to the limit, you&#39;ll need to unpublish some of your existing Solutions. This update will help ensure that resources are used efficiently while still allowing you to create and publish the Solutions you need. <br />
    <br />
    The <strong>Excel Add-In </strong>has now been modified to reflect changes in the format of the output date column based on the selected period type. The available options for period type include Quarterly, Monthly, Interval, Hourly, Yearly, and Daily.<br />
     
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quarterly or Monthly - &#39;MM YYYY&#39; - 07-2019 </li>
    <li>Interval or Hourly - &#39;DD MM YYYY: hh:mm:ss&#39; - 25-07-2019: 15:14:30 </li>
    <li>Yearly - &#39;YYYY&#39; - 2019 </li>
    <li>Daily - &#39;DD MM YYYY&#39; - 25-02-2019 </li>
  </ul>
  <p><br />
    <strong>Solution Id </strong>will be removed from <strong>Diagnostics</strong> Effective from this release, the Solution Id will not be a part of your Diagnostics Id. Please make use of CLI to query the Solution Id as mentioned below: <br />
    <br />
     
  </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">pxc solution list <em>--simulationId 9cae0cca-48c2-4d66-a79b-409023d50205</em><br />
    <br />
    pxc simulation list <em>--studyId de6b9dda-5c70-4cc6-8736-8ac83d9d6a8a</em><br />
    <br />
    pxc simulation list <em>--executionId 611c005d-5577-4044-a29f-77353fd20467</em>
  </div>
  <p><br />
     <br />
    Diagnostics are not something users should reference for automation. The CLI shows actual data for use, whereas the Diagnostics are for users to send when raising support cases, so we have the information we need to understand the context. <br />
    <br />
    For Bug Fixes, in the Excel Add-In, the <strong>Out of Sync error</strong> has been resolved when loading data. Now a confirmation popup is displayed to the user asking them to reload the data or time-series files upon clicking the Load data button in the Database tab and Data tab.   <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Known Issue: </strong>If your display name is showing incorrectly in the PLEXOS Cloud UI, particularly with special characters, simply update the value and save it to correct.<br />
