  <h2 id="1">Introduction</h2>
  <p>At Energy Exemplar, we are excited about the possibilities created by generative AI (&quot;AI&quot;). We also understand that the adoption of AI raises new risks and challenges. We are committed to the responsible development, deployment, and use of AI.<br />
    <br />
    These Responsible Al Guiding Principles and Acceptable Use Policy (this &quot;Policy&quot;) incorporate, and should be read in accordance with, your underlying agreement with Energy Exemplar. We also reserve the right to update this Policy occasionally as our experience with AI deepens or due to changes in vendor requirements, applicable laws, guidance, standards, and/or industry best practices.<br />
    <br />
    By using Energy Exemplar&#39;s Al tools, Customer acknowledges that they have read and understood this Policy and agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined herein.

  <h2 id="2">Guiding Principles</h2>
  <p>Energy Exemplar is committed to the responsible use of AI. As part of that commitment, we have adopted the following guiding principles:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Build Reliable, Trustworthy, and Secure AI Systems</h3>
  <p>We conduct comprehensive testing before fully deploying AI technologies to prevent unauthorized access and malicious use. Our goal is to ensure that our AI systems are designed to perform as they were initially intended, respond securely in various conditions of use, do not pose safety risks in unexpected situations or adverse conditions, and comply with the highest standards in information security.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Transparency</h3>
  <p>We strive to be transparent to end users about our use of AI. In some cases, we accomplish this by disclosing information about the type of AI being used within the experience itself, and in other cases, through broader disclosure of our use of AI generally, based on the stage of its life cycle. When AI is used in a decision-making process, we strive to provide information on the factors considered by the AI tool. We also believe that AI-generated content that mimics human creativity or decision-making should explicitly state that the outcome is AI-generated to avoid misleading recipients about the nature of the content.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Data Privacy and Security</h3>
  <p>Our robust data privacy and security program includes complying with applicable data protection laws, safeguarding confidential information, and following established security protocols such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II. Energy Exemplar only uses data for the specified purposes for which it is collected. Data sources are limited to what is necessary for the intended functionality. We also do not upload or input any customer data or identifying information without prior written customer approval.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Use of High-Quality AI Models</h3>
  <p>We are committed to using high-quality AI models from trusted vendors. We regularly review our vendors and data sources for quality and security purposes. While Al outputs are not guaranteed to be completely accurate, we work to verify their accuracy using a human-in-the-loop approach to cross-reference facts, data, and insights with reliable sources to ensure accuracy and prevent the spread of misinformation.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Fairness</h3>
  <p>AI technologies should be used fairly and ethically, avoiding biased or discriminatory practices. While Al outputs can potentially exhibit biases based on the training data used, we strive to mitigate these biases through consistent training programs and review of underlying assumptions and data.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Compliance and Accountability</h3>
  <p>We ensure that Al tools function correctly and that their design, development, testing, and use comply with applicable laws, regulations, and company policies. This includes laws governing data privacy, intellectual property rights, and ethical AI development and usage guidelines. We strive to maintain an updated and accurate list of all Al tools, including an indication of which product or process each Al tool is integrated into and identifying the source of all data sets used with Al tools.<span class="glosstext"></span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="3">Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>The customer is responsible for ensuring that the usage of any Energy Exemplar Al tools complies with the customer&#39;s legal obligations, standards,<br />
    practices, and internal guiding principles. These responsibilities include (but are not limited to) :</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Understand Al&#39;s Limitations</h3>
  <p>AI systems have inherent limitations, and customers should not rely solely on AI outputs for consequential and/or critical decision-making that may result in high-risk outcomes. For instance, customers should consider the context, input data, and potential biases that may impact AI-generated results.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Responsible Use of Content and Outputs</h3>
  <p>Customers are responsible for the content they share with Energy Exemplar Al tools and any actions they take based on the AI-generated output.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Responsible for Human Oversight</h3>
  <p>Customers should avoid relying entirely on AI-generated outputs to make automated decisions without human review.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Responsible Use for High-Risk Activities</h3>
  <p>Customers are responsible for and should avoid using Energy Exemplar Al for high-risk and/or high-stakes activities.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Responsible for Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h3>
  <p>Customers should ensure their use (and the use by their employees and representatives) of Energy Exemplar&#39;s Al tools comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines, such as those related to data protection, privacy and security, as well as adhering to requirements in countries or regions where the use of Al has been prohibited or otherwise limited.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <hr />
  <h2 id="4">Prohibited Use</h2>
  <p>Use of Energy Exemplar&#39;s Al tools beyond the intended purpose of the product offerings is strictly prohibited. Examples of prohibited uses include:</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Using Energy Exemplar&#39;s Al tools for illegal or unsafe behaviors, including producing harassing or violent content, malware, and/or hacking activity, activity that could result in economic harm, fraudulent or deceptive activity, disinformation, spam, activities that violate privacy, classifying individuals based on protected characteristics and/or otherwise in furtherance of a crime or activity deemed illegal in your jurisdiction.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Using Energy Exemplar&#39;s Al tools to attempt to override or circumvent safety filters or intentionally drive the model to act in a manner that contravenes this Policy.</p>
